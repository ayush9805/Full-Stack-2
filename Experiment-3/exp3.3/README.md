# Experiment 3: Multi-Page SPA Using Routing

## 📌 Aim
To create a multi-page Single Page Application (SPA) using client-side routing.

## ⚙️ Software Requirements
* **Node.js**
* **React**
* **React Router DOM**
* **Web Browser**

## 📖 Theory
A **Multi-Page SPA** behaves like a traditional multi-page website to the user (with distinct URLs and views), but it is technically a single HTML page that dynamically updates its content. 

By mapping specific components to distinct URL paths (routes), we can create the illusion of navigating between different pages (like Home, About, Contact, Services) without the performance cost of refreshing the page for every click. This results in a faster, more fluid user experience.
